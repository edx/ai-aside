Purpose
*******

This plugin holds LLM related blocks and tools, initially the summary XBlock aside but eventually more options.

Getting Started
***************

Developing
==========

One Time Setup
--------------
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:openedx/ai-aside.git
  cd ai-aside

  # Set up a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper with the same name as the repo and activate it
  mkvirtualenv -p python3.8 ai-aside

Local testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To test your changes locally, you will need to install the package from your local branch into edx-platform. For example, if using devstack, copy or clone your branch into <devstack-parent>/src/ai-aside. Bring up the LMS and CMS containers in devstack, and run this make target in the ai-aside directory::

  make install-local

You should see it uninstall any existing ai-aside in and install your local source, for both the CMS and LMS.

The plug-in configuration will automatically be picked up once installed. Changes will be hot reloaded after the next LMS or CMS restart.

If you would like to manually install ai-aside, go to your lms or cms shell and run::

  pip install -e /edx/src/ai-aside


Run Migrations
..............
You will also need to run migrations for local testing. Using the same lms or cms shell as before, run::

  ./manage.py lms migrate ai_aside


Testing in Docker with AI-spot
..............................

If you are running both devstack and a local instance of the supporting ai-spot in docker, you need two pieces of special setup to let ai-spot call the aside handler and retrieve content.

The first is to connect ai-spot to the devstack network with a docker command::

  docker network connect devstack_default ai-spot-server-1

The second is to change the handler URLs generated by ai-aside to a URL that is accessible by ai-spot in the same docker. This is already set up for you in ``summaryhook_aside/settings/devstack.py``. If your AI service is running locally outside of docker, you will need to change that setting.


Enabling the Aside
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the summary aside to work, you will have to make two changes in the LMS admin:

1. You must create an ``XBlockAsidesConfig`` (admin URL: `/admin/lms_xblock/xblockasidesconfig/`). This model has a list of blocks you do not want asides to apply to that can be left alone, and an enabled setting that unsurprisingly should be True.

2. You must enable a course waffle flag for each course you want to summarize. ``summaryhook.summaryhook_enabled`` is the main one, ``summaryhook_enabled.summaryhook_staff_only`` can be used if you only want staff to see it.

3. You must enable a course waffle flag if you want to use the feature for enabling/disabling the summary by its settings. ``summaryhook.summaryhook_summaries_configuration``. If this flag is enabled, you can enable/disable the courses and the blocks by its settings.

Aside Settings API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some endpoints that can be used to pinpoint units to be either enabled or disabled based on their configs. The new settings work as follows:
- If a course is enabled, the summary for all the blocks for that course are enabled by default.
- If a course is disabled or the setting does not exists, then the summary for all the blocks from that course are disabled by default.
- If a block has its own settings, it will override any other setting with the one that is saved.
- If a block does not have any settings saved, then the enabled state will fall back to the course's enabled state mentioned above.

The new endpoints for updating these settings are:
