Purpose
*******

This plugin holds LLM related blocks and tools, initially the summary XBlock aside but eventually more options.

Getting Started
***************

Developing
==========

One Time Setup
--------------
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:openedx/ai-aside.git
  cd ai-aside

  # Set up a virtualenv using virtualenvwrapper with the same name as the repo and activate it
  mkvirtualenv -p python3.8 ai-aside

Local testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To test your changes locally, you will need to install the package from your local branch into edx-platform. For example, if using devstack, copy or clone your branch into <devstack-parent>/src/ai-aside. Then, in an lms or cms shell, run::

  pip install -e /edx/src/ai-aside

The plug-in configuration will automatically be picked up once installed, and changes will be hot reloaded.

Run Migrations
..............
You will also need to run migrations for local testing. Using the same lms or cms shell as before, run::

  ./manage.py lms migrate ai_aside


Testing in Docker with AI-spot
..............................

If you are running both devstack and a local instance of the supporting ai-spot in docker, you need two pieces of special setup to let ai-spot call the aside handler and retrieve content.

The first is to connect ai-spot to the devstack network with a docker command::

  docker network connect devstack_default ai-spot-server-1

The second is to change the handler URLs generated by ai-aside to a URL that is accessible by ai-spot in the same docker. This is already set up for you in ``summaryhook_aside/settings/devstack.py``. If your AI service is running locally outside of docker, you will need to change that setting.


Enabling the Aside
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the summary aside to work, you will have to make two changes in the LMS admin:

1. You must create an ``XBlockAsidesConfig`` (admin URL: `/admin/lms_xblock/xblockasidesconfig/`). This model has a list of blocks you do not want asides to apply to that can be left alone, and an enabled setting that unsurprisingly should be True.

2. You must enable a course waffle flag for each course you want to summarize. ``summaryhook.summaryhook_enabled`` is the main one, ``summaryhook_enabled.summaryhook_staff_only`` can be used if you only want staff to see it.

Every time you develop something in this repo
---------------------------------------------
.. code-block::

  # Activate the virtualenv
  workon ai-aside

  # Grab the latest code
  git checkout main
  git pull

  # Install/update the dev requirements
  make requirements

  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)
  make validate

  # Make a new branch for your changes
  git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>

  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.
  vim ...

  # Run your new tests
  pytest ./path/to/new/tests

  # Run all the tests and quality checks
  make validate

  # Commit all your changes
  git commit ...
  git push

  # Open a PR and ask for review.
